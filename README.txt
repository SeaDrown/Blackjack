This is a simple application that lets the user play Blackjack against the computer, who is the dealer.

This project uses OOP, and consists of main.py, as well as a class for the Game (or round), the hands
and the deck used for each game.

To run the app, simply run main.py (via an IDE, or via the terminal)
